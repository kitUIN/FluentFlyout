# How to contribute
Any help towards improving FluentFlyout is greatly appreciated â€” whether it's new features, bug fixes, or translations!

## Developing
To start developing, load the repository into Visual Studio (or your IDE of choice), make sure that FluentFlyout is closed (singleton app), and start writing!
Make sure to create a new branch when starting. Once you're ready, submit a pull request describing what's updated, and be sure to tag any issues (if applicable) your pull request is taking care of!

## Translating
You can translate here: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluentflyout/  

The majority of FluentFlyout users (apart from English) come from China and India. If you could translate any of these two countries' languages, it would be greatly appreciated!
Apart from those countries, the following are other popular ones that would greatly benefit from your help: Turkey, Mexico, several South American countries, and Russia. Of course, feel free to help contribute to languages not listed as well!
  
FluentFlyout uses **Weblate** to manage translations, ensuring advanced translation tooling, automated merges to FluentFlyout, and appropiate crediting when you update a language you have worked on.
